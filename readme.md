NOT READY.

Note that this extension is a work in progress and not ready.
You can help contribute here and on the wren debugger branch.

This extension hasn't been tested in a while, and might need updating 
for latest vscode versions. Please bear with us!

# Goals
- Official Syntax Highlighting - wip
- Completion support - not yet
- Debugger support - wip, usable but very experimental
